## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Init]: Use milas/talos-sbc-rk3588 as base (pending validation)
- [Init]: Use Armbian device tree as reference (pending validation)
- [Init]: Target eMMC boot for production (pending validation)

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

**Phase 2 Risk (from research):**
- U-Boot defconfig for NanoPi M6 does not exist upstream
- Must adapt from R6C/R6S - may require iterative debugging
- UART console access critical for debugging boot failures
